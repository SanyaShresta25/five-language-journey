# Five-Language-Journey

A structured journey to relearn and strengthen programming fundamentals across five core languages:

- C
- Java
- Python
- JavaScript
- Go

---

## 🎯 Goal

The goal of this repository is to rebuild strong programming fundamentals by revisiting core concepts through:

- Official documentation
- Multiple learning resources
- Parallel implementation across languages
- Consistent daily practice

This is not just about learning syntax — it is about understanding how different languages solve the same problems.

---

## 📚 Focus Areas

The learning journey includes:

- Console Input / Output
- Numeric Data Types
- Arithmetic Operators
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Functions
- Basic Problem Solving

Each concept is implemented separately in all five languages to improve:

- Syntax fluency
- Logical thinking
- Cross-language comparison
- Deeper conceptual clarity

---

## 🚀 Learning Approach

Learn → Implement → Compare → Improve → Repeat

The focus is on consistency, clarity, and disciplined practice.

---

### Consistency over perfection.
